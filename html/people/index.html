					<h4>Lisa Michelsen</h4>
					<h5>Matron of Honor</h5>

					<p>Lisa and Angela have been friends for 35
					years!  Their friendship began as 3- and 2-year-olds, respectively, when Angela's family moved
					 back to Crownsville, Maryland from 
					Munich, Germany.  Lisa and Angela share so 
					many experiences together.  Although they went
					 to separate schools, they spent much of their 
					free time together and were roommates in 
					Annapolis before Angela moved to New York.  
					If you want to know anything about Angela, 
					Lisa is your source.</p>

					<p>Lisa lives in Arnold, Maryland with her husband, 
					Erik and their two, ridiculously cute kids, Sophia 
					and Leif and new puppy, Leia.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description jill">
					<h4>Jill Kotulka</h4>
					<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>

					<p>Jill and Angela met at University of Delaware
					where they were quadmates and then two
					years later, housemates.  They were both art majors, 
					as well.  Jill, being one year ahead of Angela, 
					was a valuable resource for creative advice and 
					inspiration for Angela. Jill and Angela share a 
					love of DIY Halloween costumes.  Jill holds 
					several "Best Costume" titles.  Angela's personal
					 favorite was Jill as the Damsel-in-Distress-Tied-to-the-Traintracks and her husband as the 
					Dastardly, Mustachioed Villian.</p>

					<p>Jill and her husband, Jim, live in Brooklyn, 
					New York.  They just celebrated the birth
					of their first child, Cash, in March</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description randi">
					<h4>Randi Klett</h4>
					<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>

					<p>Randi and Angela first met, through Justin at the home 
					of two others in the wedding party, Sarah Trabucchi 
					and Eric Mortensen, for a dinner get-together.  
					Randi's warm, effervescent personality made 
					Angela feel that in addition to finding a great guy
					in Justin, she had also found a great group of friends.</p>

					<p>Randi, along with one of her co-workers created
					the most amazing app, called Robots for iPad.
					It is the penultimate resource for all your robot needs.</p>

					<p>Randi and her husband, Jared, also in the 
					wedding party, live in Brooklyn, New York.  
					They just welcomed their first child, Oliver, in April.</p>

				<div class="description justin-angela">
					<h4>Angela Lind &amp; Justin Day</h4>
					<h5>Bride &amp; Groom</h5>

					<p>Angela and Justin initially met in a magical 
					place called the Internet.  Over the course the 
					next couple of years they got to know each other 
					as friends, collaborating on projects, going to 
					events and just general hanging out.  This time 
					together made Justin and Angela realize that they 
					were more than just kindred spirits, they had found 
					their soul mates.</p>

					<p>Justin proposed to Angela on August 30th, 2012
					At Burning Man at twilight in the Temple.  The
					first, playa-safe ring was a beautiful hot pink 
					acrylic ring, topped with a single LED that Justin 
					designed and created.  The second, official, ring 
					is a rose gold and diamond stunner, custom-made
					by their goldsmith neighbor, Maximo.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description sarah">
					<h4>Sarah Trabucchi</h4>
					<h5>Officiant</h5>

					<p>Sarah is a best-selling romance novelist and
					the wife of Eric Mortensen, the best man.
					Sarah has been friends with Justin for many years
					and was introduced to Angela a little over a year
					ago and they became fast friends.</p>

					<p>Sarah and Eric live in Brooklyn, New York with
					the greatest dog in the world, Baxter.
					Sarah and Eric's home in Brooklyn is the site
					for many get togethers where the evenings always
					end with sore cheeks from too much laughter.</p>

					<p>Justin and Angela choose Sarah to be the
					officiant for her eloquent, thoughtful words and 
					her love of true love.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description eric">
					<h4>Eric Mortensen</h4>
					<h5>Best Man</h5>

					<p>
						Eric and Justin have known each other since 1992, when they met in Fresno, California. As high functioning computer dorks, they hung out in the same online venues and somehow discovered that they lived just a block apart, separated by the high school they both attended. They were eventually roommates and coworkers in Fresno and ultimately took that show on the road to NYC, where they did the same. They've shared countless projects, workplaces and adventures over the years and have lived in some of the most exotic (AKA comically deformed and haphazardly furnished) residences on either coast of the United States. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Eric, his wife Sarah and their dog Baxter live in Brooklyn, NY.

				<div class="description jake">
					<h4>Jake Joaquin</h4>
					<h5>Groomsman</h5>

					<p>Jake and Justin met in seventh grade at Kastner Intermediate School and have been life-long friends ever since. They have always shared a passion for computers and video games. In 2002, they both migrated to Brooklyn  together as part of a mass migration from Fresno. Theyâ€™ve worked together, created interactive art together, and have been to Burning Man together. In short, they probably know too much about each other.</p>

					<p>Jacob lives with his wife Cate, their daughter Giada, and their 3 cats in Fresno, California.</p>

				<div class="description jared">
					<h4>Jared Klett</h4>
					<h5>Groomsman</h5>

					<p>Jared first met Justin in 2002 over Indian food when they happened to sit across from each other at a meetup in Manhattan for tech enthusiasts. Thanks to such shared interests, they became fast friends and worked on many projects together over the years, one of which became a company they co-founded, Blip.tv.</p>

					<p>Jared and his wife, Randi, live in Brooklyn, New York. They welcomed their first child, Oliver, into the world in April.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description mike">
					<h4>Mike Hudack</h4>
					<h5>Groomsman</h5>

					<p>Mike first met Justin at the NYC Geeks Indian dinner meetup in 2002.  Together with Jared and two others they founded Blip.tv.</p>

					<p>Mike and his wife, Caroline, live in San Francisco.</p>
