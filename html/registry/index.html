		<p>We created a page with the Alzheimer's Association in honor of Angela's mother, Susan Lind, who passed away on July 19th after a 10-year battle with Alzheimer's. Please feel free to give a donation in lieu of a gift.</p>

		<p>Being in our mid-30's, our household is complete with items that are found in a traditional registry. Truly, the best gift you can give us is coming to our wedding.  But, we understand tradition and you may want to celebrate our marriage by giving a gift.  The best alternative we could think of is a honeymoon contribution site.  We would love to have an adventure in Paris as a start of our lives together as husband and wife.</p>
