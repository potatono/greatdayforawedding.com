		<p>We created a page with the Alzheimer's Association in honor of Angela's mother, Susan Lind, who is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's and will be unable to attend the wedding. Please feel free to give a donation in lieu of a gift.</p>

		<p>Being in our mid-30's, our household is complete with items that are found in a traditional registry. Truly, the best gift you can give us is coming to our wedding.  But, we understand tradition and you may want to celebrate our marriage by giving a gift.  The best alternative we could think of is a honeymoon contribution site.  We would love to have an adventure in Paris as a start of our lives together as husband and wife.</p>
