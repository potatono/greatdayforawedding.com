	<h2>Kent Manor Inn</h2>

	<div class="text">
		<p>The 1820 Historic Kent Manor Inn is located at
		500 Kent Manor Drive on Kent Island in 
		Stevensville Maryland.</p>
		
		<p>The Inn and glass-enclosed Garden House sit on 
		220 acres of woods and farmland, including a mile 
		of waterfront on the shore of the Thompson Creek.</p>
		
		<p>The Inn and area hotels are about a 35-minute drive from 
		BWI Airport and BWI Amtrak Rail Station.
		Rental cars are available at BWI Airport.</p>
		
		<p>If you are driving directly to the wedding Friday evening,
		we recommend that you check the traffic reports early
		as traffic over the Bay Bridge on Friday evening could be 
		significantly backed up.</p>
